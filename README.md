# ETF Market Analyzer

ETF Analyzer is a Python-based project designed to analyze the performance of ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and their constituent stocks for the previous market trading day. This tool fetches data from financial APIs (such as Yahoo Finance) to calculate daily gains or losses for both the ETF and individual stocks within the fund. It provides a detailed breakdown of each stock's point and percentage gains and their contribution to the overall performance of the ETF.
